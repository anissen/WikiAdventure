WikiAdventure
=============

WikiAdventure is game framework that uses user contributed content from special Wiki pages to create games. It is not a game in itself, but it allows you, the user, to easily create interactive stories and games by creating Wiki pages in a special syntax.

When a WikiAdventure game is launched, all the content from the game's content pages is downloaded, including media such as images and fonts, and the content is parsed and organised. The game will then be run using the set up of the game's content pages.

Note
----
The game data used to be available at http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/Special:Undelete/Community_Projects:WikiAdventure but has been deleted now. If anybody is interested contact me, and I _can_ restore the pages.
